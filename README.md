## About ShapeShift DAO

ShapeShift is a borderless, cross-chain crypto trading platform and portfolio manager for user self-sovereignty. FOX Token holders govern the ShapeShift DAO and can vote to allocate the treasury of FOX and any revenues generated by the ShapeShift ecosystem. 

The company, under the leadership of Erik Voorhees and co-founder "Jon Shapeshift," launched its initial version in the summer of 2014 with Litecoin as the first altcoin available for instant swaps to and from Bitcoin. 

In July 2021, ShapeShift publicly announced its plans to decentralize the entire company while conducting one of the largest airdrops in history of FOX tokens, which would eventually be used for decentralized governance processes.
